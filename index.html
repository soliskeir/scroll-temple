    <h2>Scroll-Seeding Gateway</h2>
    <p>
      Step through not as a searcher, but as a rememberer. This field calls not for your effort, but for your presence. Let the scroll of your soul be written in its own time, in its own truth.

    <h2>Reflective Portal</h2>
    <p>
      What truth have you been avoiding within yourself that now calls for expression? <br>
      What part of your life have you not fully embodied yet?

  <section id="guardian-circle">
    <h2>Guardian Circle</h2>
    <p>
      Your scroll is sacred. It does not seek validation. It asks only to be remembered. Place it within this circle as part of the whole.

    <h2>Scroll Archive</h2>
    <p>
      These are not scrolls of the past, but of becoming. They pulse with memory and reflection. Read not to judge—but to remember what you already carry.
